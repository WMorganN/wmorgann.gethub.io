                <p> Hello, my name is Will and I am a junior at Kennesaw State University. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Cyber Security and Networking. I found great interest in this field as I started out with programming in my freshman year of college. I shifted my interests from the coding perspective to network security after taking classes such as Data Communication and Networking and Operation Systems Concepts and Administration.  </p>
                <p> Beyond academics, I enjoy powerlifting and being active. I started working out during the second semester of my senior year in high school. I quickly fell in love with the gym and always craved being the strongest of my friend group. After discovering powerlifting, my love for the gym only increased. Over the past few years, my schedule has shifted from being disorganized to revolving around my training cycle. I also find activity outside of the gym. When the weather is pleasant, I can be found either on a hike or going camping. I find that being out in nature helps me to think clearly and improves my mental health. </p>
                <p> In both my academic pursuits and personal endeavors, I try my best to improve constantly. I am excited to kickstart my career in Information Technology by seeking out opportunities and internships to expand my knowledge and resume.  </p>
